  """Computes same-entity-set-retrieval loss.

  We want to maximize attention scores received by memories which passages have
  large enough entity overlap (at least `same_entity_set_target_threshold`
  unique entities in common) with query mention's passage.

  User specifies which entity IDs exist in the current batch via the arguments:
  `mention_target_batch_positions`, `mention_target_ids` and
  `mention_target_weights`. Note that these correspond to linked mentions. While
  we retrieve memories for all mentions, we don't know entity IDs for non-linked
  mentions and they are not needed for computing entity overlap.

  Formally, let E(j) be the set of entity IDs in the j-th sample in the batch.
  k-th retrieval for i-th mention is "correct" if and only if
  IntersectionSize(E(mention_batch_positions[i]), memory_text_entities[i, j]) is
  at least `same_entity_set_target_threshold`.

  The loss is first computed for every mention separately and is negative log of
  sum of memory_attention_weights[i, j] where j is a "correct" retrieval for the
  i-th mention. The final loss is average of losses for those mentions which
  have at least one "correct" retrieval.

  Args:
    mention_target_batch_positions: [n_target_mentions] position of a linked
      (target) mention in its batch.
    mention_target_ids: [n_target_mentions] IDs of mentions.
    mention_target_weights: [n_target_mentions] per-mention weight for linked
      (target) mentions indicating whether a mention is padding or not.
    mention_batch_positions: [n_mentions] position of a mention in its batch.
    mention_mask: [n_mentions] whether a mention is padding or not.
    memory_text_entities: [n_mentions, k_top, n_memory_text_entities] IDs of
      mentions in the passage where memory is coming from.
    memory_attention_weights: [n_mentions, k_top] attention weights for the
      retrieval results.
    memory_mask: [n_mentions, k_top] which retrievals to use and which are to
      ignore in the loss computations. Typical usage is to ignore "disallowed"
      or same-passage retrievals.
    batch_size: batch size.
    same_entity_set_target_threshold: how many common entities needs to be
      between memory's passage and mention's passage in order to treat retrieval
      result as positive. If it's equal to 2 this loss becomes
      `same-mtb-retrieval` loss.

  Returns:
    Tuple of scalar loss, avg correct probability and normalizing factor.
